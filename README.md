This repository contains code and metadata for the 221014Esv Illumina run. It includes code to
i) turn CZID biom files into phyloseq objects (illumina_import_and_datacleaning.Rmd)
ii) analyses of the resulting phyloseq objects (Illumina_analysis.RmD)
iii) import of kraken2 results and linking kraken2 data with [ICTV metadata](https://ictv.global/vmr) (Illumina_kraken2_import.Rmd), a

# Illumina Pilot
This repository contains code and metadata for the 221014Esv Illumina run. It will also include scripts to i) upload data to CZID and ii) analyze results in R.

# Samples
DNA sequences that are analyzed here stem from 12 Illumina samples; gained from aliquots from the same 0.5L wastewater sample, taken from an anonymous wastewater plant.

More information on the sequencing runs can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QiYgZGewYyg2gFzawYGRzTuMXbvwpJsTy27k3IrH3fQ/edit#)(only accessible for NAO members).

# TODO
1. Edit water control status in CZID.
2. Add instructions to download sequences.
3. Add failed Illumina runs (i.e. empty fastq files) to README and CZID description

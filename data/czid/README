## More information on gsnap.hitsummary2.tab provided by CZID support:

The progression of read assignment (from initial short read TaxID to refined assembly-based TaxlD) can be identified in the hitsummary2 files (`gsnap.hitsummary2.tab` and `rapsearch2.hitsummary2.tab`)

A typical row in the hitsummary2 file looks like this:
NB501961:211:HGWKCBGX9:1:11205:5935:16320/1 1155900 GQ881617.1 155900 -200 -300 NODE_1497_length

The .tab file contains 12 columns:
1. Read ID
2. Taxonomy level (all -1)
3. Final TaxID assignment
4. Initial (single short-read) GenBank alignment
5. TaxID (species), from single alignment - obtained from the accession2taxid mapping after SNAP or Rapsearch2.
*note: *the pipeline outputs species-level counts as well as genus-level counts. For rows corresponding to genus-level
counts (tax_level = 2), the species taxID is listed as "-100".
6. TaxID (genus), from single alignment - obtained by walking the phylogenetic tree backwards. If there is no genus-level classification, this value will be "-200".
7. TaxID (family), from single alignment - obtained by walking the phylogenetic tree backwards. If there is no family-level classification, this value will be "-300".
8. Assembled contig that this read maps to
9. The GenBank ID that the contig mapped to
10. TaxID (species), from assembled contig - obtained from the accession2taxid mapping after BLAST
11. Tax/D (genus), from assembled contig
12. TaxID (family), from assembled contig
13. "from_assembly" - this flag indicates whether this read was mapped ONLY through assembly. If this flag is present, then fields (4) - (7) are duplicates of the assembly-based TaxID call, and are not single short-read alignments.

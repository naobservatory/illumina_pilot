This folder contains Kraken2 reports, run by Phil Palmer. The reports are named by the sample ID, every report is a tab delimited .txt file.

The different columns in the report are:

1) Percentage of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
2) Number of fragments covered by the clade rooted at this taxon
3) Number of fragments assigned directly to this taxon
4) A rank code indicating (U)nclassified, (R)oot, (D)omain, (K)ingdom, (P)hylum, (C)lass,
(O)rder, (F)amily, (G)enus, (S)pecies. Taxa that are not any of these 10 ranks have a
rank code that is formed by using the rank code of the closest ancestor rank with a
number indicating the distance from that rank. Ex. Lampyrinae has a rank code of
“F1” because it is a subfamily one step below Lampyridae (the firefly family).
5) The Taxonomic ID number from NCBI
